        <div>Every account is defined by a pair of keys: (1) a private key and (2) a public key. Each account has an
            address that is derived from the public key by using the last 20 bytes of information. The private key is
            the secret half of your address/public key. The private key consists of 64 hexadecimal characters that
            should look like this: c906cbc4f8e037e1eaf03bd5c205aff0d4d9fb195c40e90968bd6ed51679a142. If you misspell any portion of the private key, you will be attempting to access a different wallet. Without your private key
            you cannot access your funds.</div>

        <div>The private key is an unencrypted private key, unlike the keystore which is encrypted. <strong>Anyone with
            access to your private key can control your wallet.</strong> If you do not have your private key you do not
            own your wallet. We advise you not keep your private key and simply use your mnemonic or keystore to keep
            your wallet secure. Since the keystore and mnemonic are encrypted they are safer than the private key.
            Remember: We do not save your password, once forgotten, it cannot be recovered.</div>
